# Stranger Threads Sample Code

The code samples in the blog post can be found in the unit tests.

**Note** This sample code requires a Mac. Windows and Linux versions 
are possible but we'll need some help setting that up.

## To Run

On the command line run

```
./gradlew build
```

That's it. Gradle should run your tests, assuming you're on a mac.
